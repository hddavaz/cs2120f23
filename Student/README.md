# Student Directory

This is the directory in which you should do all of your work. Whenever you need to change a file that the instructor has provided, copy it into this directory (or a subdirectory) first, then make your changes. If you forget to do this and inadvertently change a file in the Instructor directory, follow the instructions in the READE.md file in the Instructor directory.
